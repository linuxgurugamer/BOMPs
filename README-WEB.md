This is a continuing revivial of the old BOMPs thread.  The mod was originally made by @Ted, and revived by @jinks for 0.90, original thread here: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/70837-0900-the-bolt-on-mission-probe-bomp-revival-thread/

 

I now present to you BOMPs for the modern age

What the heck are BOMPs?

 

Bolt-On Mission Probes are unmanned command modules or probe cores. They have been created by Ted in a time when the currently available probe cores didn't yet exist.

Since then they have kind of fallen by the wayside. Ted is certainly occupied with his job as QA Lead at Squad and when stock probe cores were added, BOMPs weren't needed so sorely any more.

When partconfigs got updated, KSP gained features and the landscape changed, BOMPs stopped working.

 

The stats are pretty much in line with the stock probe cores.

Why would I use a BOMP instead of a standard probe core?

You remember them from when they were the only option and are a bit nostalgic.
You think they are prettier than the standard probe cores. (Hint: They are!)
You need a 3.75m stack probe core.
You just feel like it.
Where can I get my very own set of BOMPs?
